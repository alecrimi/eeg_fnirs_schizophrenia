# EEG fNIRS Schizophrenia improvement validation

This project is currently ongoing so we cannot disclose much

However, builing-in-public we realized we had brain conecomes of different modalities, and the need to find statistically significant differences at the level of connectivity in a multi-modal manner. This currently is not supported by the Network based statistics (NBS) by Zalesky et al. (NBS), or at least you have to pass the networks individually. Here, you can find a code to do that in a multy-layer manner. Passing, 2 or more networks for the same subject (e.g. EEG, fNIRS, fMRI, or others).

Currently main script for multiplex-NBS:

This is a continuation of the work on muti-layer networks EEG-fNIRS done in the following paper:
